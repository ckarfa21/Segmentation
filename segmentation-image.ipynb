Les algorithmes pour classifier les images peuvent permettre d’aider au diagnostic en classant une image dans une catégorie particulière de pathologie. Les algorithmes pour segmenter les images sont couramment utilisés sur tous les types d’imagerie et en routine au CHRU. C’est ainsi que l’IA permet un gain de temps aux praticiens à la fois pour le diagnostic ou lors d’interventions. Elle présente aussi l’avantage de contourner certains biais liés à l’interprétation de l’opérateur.\n","\n","Pour se mettre un peu dans le contexte, vous pouvez lire l'article
